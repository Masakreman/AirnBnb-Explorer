That's why we would like to make our home (or spare room) available to people who want to explore Dublin - we can get a bit of the travelling experience from our visitors! We both like movies and books, box sets of Sopranos, The Wire (and a little bit of Downton just for me) and, of course, Guinness. We are vegetarians, but wouldn't mind if a guest wanted to cook meat, and we love eating out or creating our own feasts whenever we can.

Eamon is a writer and teaches English as a foreign language and I work in a university. Through work, and because we have travelled and lived abroad ourselves, we are used to dealing with people from different countries. \r\n\r\nOur house is in Rathfarnham which is a lovely area in the Southside of Dublin. We are serviced by the 16 Bus to Dublin International Airport (bus stop is 2 minute walk from our house!) and we are only 20 minutes away from Dublin city centre by bus or tram (Luas as it’s called in Irish!). \r\nWe live within walking distance from a shopping centre, the river Dodder, big green spaces (Bushy Park, Marlay Park and St Enda’s Park) and other amenities (restaurants, cinema, pubs).\r\n\r\nWe are at the foothills of the Dublin Mountains and the Wicklow Way –which is the Irish equivalent of the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage- officially starts 10 minute-walk from us, in Marlay Park. We are also very close to the sea, there is a bus literally at our doorstep which brings you to Dun Laoghaire, on the coast.\r\n\r\nWe have a little dog, Elvis. He absolutely loves human company and is friendly to new people but likes doing his own thing. He is a middle aged dog, so he sleeps most of the time.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other queries, we will be delighted to help.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our home!\r\n","host_response_time":"within a few hours","host_response_rate":"100%","host_acceptance_rate":"67%","host_identity_verified":true,"current_listings":[{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b9027177e0"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"671d85e86b263e05b68c3cca"},"host_name":"Yvonne","host_verifications":["email","phone"],"host_since":"2015-02-06","host_location":"Dublin, Ireland","host_about":"I am an easy going friendly girl.

Before moving in, we reinvented the interior of the house to create a bright open space with a total remodel. We love our first home here in this truly unique award winning North Dublin neighbourhood. This property is now rented full-time.\n\nThe blue Victorian house is our family home in Boise, Idaho in another wonderfully appreciated historic neighborhood (USA now, proper spellings). We are walking distance from downtown in the city's East End. The quiet apartment is above our family home. It has a seperate entrance and all the amenities required for a comfortable stay. It’s been updated and set up for short term contract professionals - but we host tourists too. This location is ideal. \n\nThe Cheerful Cottage is located in central Nampa, Idaho and James worked hard during 2021 to bring this previously neglected property some new life.  In July 2022 it became ready for you to enjoy.  An adorable 1 bedroom property with a fenced shady yard and relaxing patio bordered by a single car garage. A bright quiet space with everything you need for a short or long term visit. \n\nMegan is a Musician and Music Teacher. James, an Artist, a Designer, a Director and Research Manager. The kids are not ready to settle on a profession just yet other than as students (in school and of the world).\nWe love to travel and spend time with with friends and family.","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":"100%","host_acceptance_rate":"95%","host_identity_verified":true,"current_listings":[{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b9027177ed"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"671d85e86b263e05b68c3ccd"},"host_name":"Barbara","host_verifications":["email","phone"],"host_since":"2014-07-23","host_location":"Mullingar, Ireland","host_about":"My family is very important to me and I'm interested in visual arts, architecture, interiors, crafts, and the great outdoors.

Why does the idea of talking about oneself strike fear in one's heart, is it that we're just too bashful or the subject matter might be boring, ha.  I'm a mother of two wonderful young adults. I took up running some years ago and have ran many International Marathons including some of the majors New York, Boston, London, Paris, San Francisco all of which I qualified for where necessary.  I'm a glass half full type of person and certainly believe that if plan A doesn't work, there's always plan B, C, etc.,.  I enjoy meeting people and hosting with Airbnb has been a terrific experience for me in that regard.  In general I love to see people enjoying life and if I can help them in that goal, all the better.  I'm a believer in karma and thus each day is an opportunity to do something good and make people happy.  Of course , I have a huge work ethic and I like to give a 100% to whatever I'm working on.  I'm a  cleanliness freak, having had a bad experience in what I thought was a good hotel in London, long story short, I jumped into bed after a long day in London and a late theatre night, in the morning when I woke, I noticed there was a brown coffee stain on my sheet, obviously the sheets had not been changed, I was Not a happy camper!  Who would have thought, needless to say, I check wherever I stay now!   \r\nI love Dublin city and the people, I'm a Dubliner even though my Dad hailed from County Kerry (the California of Ireland), and my Mum from County Westmeath.  I love to pretend to be a tourist in my own city, the things you notice and discover, always something new.  Life always has moments to be recorded, thus the advent of phones with cameras has enabled me to embrace my other passion, photography, I think I have at least 20,000 photos,  thank goodness for iCloud.\r\nHope all that didn't bore you too much, have a wonderful day, Namaste.:-)","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":"100%","host_acceptance_rate":"100%","host_identity_verified":true,"current_listings":[{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b9027179cb"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"671d85e86b263e05b68c3e19"},"host_name":"Pauline","host_verifications":["email","phone"],"host_since":"2017-05-24","host_location":"Dublin, Ireland","host_about":"I live with my two adult children .

I’m admittedly a bit of a perfectionist, but still i'm a very laid back and caring person. I’ve been told I’m a good listener and offer sound advice and try always to be easy going and open to new ideas & opinions. I go to the gym whenever i can and enjoy both watching and playing sports, with football and tennis probably being my two favourite. I absolutely love to give travel advice and tips to guest visiting Ireland, as i am also extremely proud of my country, it's people and it's history and always wish the very best experience possible for anyone who visits & i hope i can help them to experience the very best that Ireland has to offer.\r\n","host_response_time":"within a few hours","host_response_rate":"70%","host_acceptance_rate":"0%","host_identity_verified":true,"current_listings":[{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b9027179f9"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"671d85e86b263e05b68c3e3a"},"host_name":"Jamie","host_verifications":["email","phone"],"host_since":"2016-05-22","host_location":"Dublin, Ireland","host_about":"young architect,  i designed my own home which i am proud to welcome guests to; i love to travel and enjoy other beautiful homes..","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":"100%","host_acceptance_rate":"100%","host_identity_verified":true,"current_listings":[{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b9027179fb"},{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902717ae5"},{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902717b21"},{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902717b2d"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"671d85e86b263e05b68c3e3b"},"host_name":"Paul","host_verifications":["email","phone"],"host_since":"2017-08-23","host_location":"England, United Kingdom","host_about":"Engineer working abroad looking to rent my apartment.","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":"100%","host_acceptance_rate":"100%","host_identity_verified":true,"current_listings":[{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902717a05"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"671d85e86b263e05b68c3e3c"},"host_name":"Christopher","host_verifications":["email","phone"],"host_since":"2015-07-25","host_location":"Dublin, Ireland","host_about":"Born and bred in Dublin I will be happy to help you with recommendations, etc. I usually rent my house when I go away travelling which is my biggest passion.","host_response_time":"within a few hours","host_response_rate":"100%","host_acceptance_rate":"100%","host_identity_verified":true,"current_listings":[{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902717a01"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"671d85e86b263e05b68c3e3d"},"host_name":"Maxim","host_verifications":["email","phone"],"host_since":"2016-06-22","host_location":"County Dublin, Ireland","host_about":"Friendly professional traveller.","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":"100%","host_acceptance_rate":"67%","host_identity_verified":true,"current_listings":[{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b9027179fa"},{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902718d0e"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"671d85e86b263e05b68c3e3e"},"host_name":"Miriam","host_verifications":["phone"],"host_since":"2017-08-15","host_location":null,"host_about":"Miriam and Kieran look forward to meeting new guests .","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":"100%","host_acceptance_rate":"100%","host_identity_verified":true,"current_listings":[{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902717a03"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"671d85e86b263e05b68c3e3f"},"host_name":"Beata","host_verifications":["email","phone"],"host_since":"2017-08-28","host_location":"Dublin, Ireland","host_about":null,"host_response_time":"within a few hours","host_response_rate":"100%","host_acceptance_rate":"67%","host_identity_verified":true,"current_listings":[{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902717a00"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"671d85e86b263e05b68c3e40"},"host_name":"Doug","host_verifications":["email","phone"],"host_since":"2012-01-26","host_location":"Dublin, Ireland","host_about":"I am a friendly warm professional born and bred in Dublin.

I write, lecture, conduct tastings etc. I am a widow with 5 adult children , all married with families. 15 grandchildren, all in various careers: finance,language teaching, yachting, advertising, tourism, accountancy, design, wine trade, business or still studying. A busy life.With travel etc. Occasionally, I let the whole house, for a couple of weeks in June or July if it happens to be available,  while I take a holiday myself.  Very suitable for families on holiday with the big garden. It is proving very popular for Irish families who live abroad, coming home for holidays. \nThe rest of the academic year I live here myself but host long term guests, students or young professionals on a self-catering basis. In August each year, my own family come home from Italy. For most of that month I host nobody. \n\nDue to the current Covid-19 pandemic I am afraid I have to insist that any guest arriving must be able to prove that they have been fully vaccinated against the virus. I cannot accept anyone who has not been vaccinated, due to my age and health profile. So sorry! \n\nSince Covid, and because of pressure on available accommodation in Dublin, I am now also limiting my guests to those needing  long-stays. That is, ideally at least one month although there might be exceptions for two week periods from time to time. \n\nHowever, I am asking long-stay guests if they have more than a normal amount of luggage, e,g two or three large suitcases, that they would arrange self-storage for large boxes, equipment, furniture etc. I have had several guests who have brought  \nenormous and multiple boxes of goods and this is not convenient to store in a regular house. It is not fair on the other guests if it takes up space in shared areas.

We want to change the game with unique spaces that inspire and that can be remarkable and affordable at the same time.\n\nThe Hiphipstay story started back in 2015 when our founder Will McGlade was travelling around the US with his mates. During their travels, vacation rentals were always their first choice over hotels. They loved the added comfort of renting a home in a city or a coastal town and living like a local.\n\nHow we got started ?\n\nWill recognised a gap in the homestay market back home Ireland. He wanted to put an end to having to trawl through hundreds of average listings to find something special. So he created a platform that made it simple to rent the absolute best homes available, where hotel meets home.\n\nWhere we’re going ?\n\nWhat began as a journey to provide a better stay has grown into a celebration of modern design and exceptional comfort. We’re working with world-class software developers, hosts and designers to create truly remarkable spaces—ones that transcend hospitality and enrich lives to bring Hiphipstay to be a truly global brand.\n\n\n\n\n\n","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":"93%","host_acceptance_rate":"100%","host_identity_verified":true,"current_listings":[{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902717c5e"},{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b9027189f8"},{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902718a0d"},{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902718e40"},{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902718e41"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"671d85e86b263e05b68c3f8d"},"host_name":"Vicky","host_verifications":["email","phone"],"host_since":"2014-09-05","host_location":null,"host_about":null,"host_response_time":"within a day","host_response_rate":"70%","host_acceptance_rate":"40%","host_identity_verified":true,"current_listings":[{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902717c4f"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"671d85e86b263e05b68c3f8e"},"host_name":"Kate","host_verifications":["email","phone"],"host_since":"2013-10-31","host_location":"Kildare, Ireland","host_about":null,"host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":"100%","host_acceptance_rate":"100%","host_identity_verified":true,"current_listings":[{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902717c56"},{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b90271876a"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"671d85e86b263e05b68c3f8f"},"host_name":"Teresa","host_verifications":["email","phone"],"host_since":"2019-06-11","host_location":null,"host_about":null,"host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":"100%","host_acceptance_rate":"95%","host_identity_verified":true,"current_listings":[{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902717c54"},{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902717c55"},{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902717c57"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"671d85e86b263e05b68c3f90"},"host_name":"James","host_verifications":["email","phone"],"host_since":"2015-08-11","host_location":"Dublin, Ireland","host_about":null,"host_response_time":"within a few hours","host_response_rate":"100%","host_acceptance_rate":"100%","host_identity_verified":true,"current_listings":[{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902717c7e"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"671d85e86b263e05b68c3f91"},"host_name":"Debbie","host_verifications":["phone"],"host_since":"2019-05-09","host_location":null,"host_about":null,"host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":"100%","host_acceptance_rate":"94%","host_identity_verified":true,"current_listings":[{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b902717c5b"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"671d85e86b263e05b68c3f92"},"host_name":"Mariangela","host_verifications":["email","phone","work_email"],"host_since":"2012-02-27","host_location":"Dublin, Ireland","host_about":"I am a very communicative person.

look back on and have pleasure in talking about.\r\n\r\nTo that end travelling has become a passion and fuels my desire to experience different cultures and societies, above all it allows me to meet different people and create those memories.\r\n\r\nWhen visiting different Countries however comfort is everything to me so I love food (of course) but often get into trouble trying to experiment with unknown dishes but don't worry I always make up for that by enjoying local wines (funnily enough always white) and cocktails.\r\n\r\nWhere would the World be without cocktails or come to think about it \"liquor of any type\" if your willing to try anything just that once.\r\n\r\nThe endless amount of destinations to choose from and the history, architecture and culture open to us amazes me, I always find myself re-evaluating my lifestyle and personal choices once I've been away and continually feel grateful in terms of what I have and the possibilities available to any individual if she or he puts his / her mind to it. \r\n\r\nLove meeting new people especially if they have interesting life stories or are from different warps of life, they always appear to have a different or more open aspect on the world or it seems life in general.\r\n\r\nCouldn't live without an iron, a smart phone, a credit card, a comfortable pair of shoes or more importantly my partner who will always be the love of my life and hopefully soon to be wife. \r\n\r\nFavorite destination impossible to choose from, to many I've seen and want to go back to and to many still left to see and already on my listof must dos.\r\n\r\nBooks give me, action, espionage or mob related, probably the same with movies, although, every now and again something that will bring a tear to my eye most recently being The Help or The Bucket List or a classic The Shawshank Redemption etc. \r\n\r\nIn terms of being a host I try to provide guests with any and everything they might possibly need to make their stay more enjoyable and comfortable, the more information I can provide the better, always good to no what is available locally and where to go if you need something, from the closest and best restaurant to renting a vehicle at a competitive rate, the nearest Church or good watering hole. \r\n\r\nDublin is one of the most amazing cities in the world as everything is so accessible, the mountains or a beach all a 20 minute drive away or easily available to you via public transport.\r\n\r\nAs a major European city you will find a constant and endless abundance of culture and entertainment available to you. I just hope you have enough time to experience it all and if not it will just give you an excuse to return.","host_response_time":"within an hour","host_response_rate":"100%","host_acceptance_rate":"44%","host_identity_verified":true,"current_listings":[{"$oid":"671d757a505c07b9027187d3"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"671d85e86b263e05b68c4676"},"host_name":"Nathan","host_verifications":["email","phone"],"host_since":"2022-11-13","host_location":null,"host_about":"Hi there!\n\nWe’re GuestReady, a professional property management company helping hosts worldwide deliver outstanding experiences to their guests.\n\nWe welcome all guests, clean and prepare our homes for your arrival and will be available 24/7 should you have any questions or requests.
